# dotfiles

dot files and things to do when you get a new laptop

* Swap ctrl and caps lock
* Change "Move left a space" and "Move right a space" to be Shift+Command to avoid conflict
* Install the dot files into `~` with

    ```bash
    ./scripts/install.sh
    ```

* Run `(package-refresh-contents)` before installing emacs packages
